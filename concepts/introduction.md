# Introduction

Welcome to the Uphold API â€” we're glad to have you! Here you can find all the documentation you need to help you create custom and revolutionary new services powered by the Uphold Platform. Together, with your ingenuity, we can serve the needs of individuals and organizations across the globe and change the financial services ecosystem forever.

## API code samples

To help you get started, we have prepared a set of fully functional **[code samples](https://github.com/uphold/rest-api-examples).**
Each of these is a self-contained mini-project, with step-by-step documentation, built specifically to be downloaded and run locally.
You can inspect the demo code of these samples to get acquainted with how to use the Uphold API to perform various actions, such as making authenticated requests and creating transactions.
By default, all of the samples use our [Sandbox environment](https://wallet-sandbox.uphold.com), which provides a safe playground to experiment with the API without using real funds.

You may also use our [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/uphold/uphold-sdk-javascript), a JavaScript API client library that provides a higher-level and richer experience in integrating with our API.

## API Changes
